The new material design style navigation drawer

## Overview

The navigation drawer is a panel that displays the appâ€™s main navigation options on the left edge of the screen.
The objective of this exercise is to build navigation drawer based on material design guidelines. 

To achieve this, there are a few different components in this app:

1. `DrawerLayout` - The main layout for your activity. This will contain a FrameLayout which displays the contents of the fragment selected
2. `NavigationView` - It is a container for the Header View and Menu which you are going to use in your sliding drawer
3. `drawer_view` - This will be the list of items you show in the Drawer. Items can be grouped into sub-groups also using this menu xml file
4. `ActionBarDrawerToggle` - This is the class used to indicate to the user when a drawer is being opened or closed
